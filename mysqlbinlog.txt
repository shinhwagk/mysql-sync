the mysql command line client.

Usage: mysqlbinlog [options] log-files
  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
  --base64-output=name
                      Determine when the output statements should be
                      base64-encoded BINLOG statements: 'never' disables it and
                      works only for binlogs without row-based events;
                      'decode-rows' decodes row events into commented
                      pseudo-SQL statements if the --verbose option is also
                      given; 'auto' prints base64 only when necessary (i.e.,
                      for row-based events and format description events).  If
                      no --base64-output[=name] option is given at all, the
                      default is 'auto'.
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
  --character-sets-dir=name
                      Directory for character set files.
  -C, --compress      Use compression in server/client protocol.
  -d, --database=name List entries for just this database (local log only).
  --rewrite-db=name   Rewrite the row event to point so that it can be applied
                      to a new database
  -#, --debug[=#]     This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --debug-check       This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --debug-info        This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --default-auth=name Default authentication client-side plugin to use.
  -D, --disable-log-bin
                      Disable binary log. This is useful, if you enabled
                      --to-last-log and are sending the output to the same
                      MySQL server. This way you could avoid an endless loop.
                      You would also like to use it when restoring after a
                      crash to avoid duplication of the statements you already
                      have. NOTE: you will need a SUPER privilege to use this
                      option.
  -F, --force-if-open Force if binlog was not closed properly.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-force-if-open to disable.)
  -f, --force-read    Force reading unknown binlog events.
  -H, --hexdump       Augment output with hexadecimal and ASCII event dump.
  -h, --host=name     Get the binlog from server.
  -i, --idempotent    Notify the server to use idempotent mode before applying
                      Row Events
  -l, --local-load=name
                      Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in the
                      specified directory.
  -o, --offset=#      Skip the first N entries.
  -p, --password[=name]
                      Password to connect to remote server.
  --plugin-dir=name   Directory for client-side plugins.
  -P, --port=#        Port number to use for connection or 0 for default to, in
                      order of preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT,
                      /etc/services, built-in default (3306).
  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe,
                      memory).
  -R, --read-from-remote-server
                      Read binary logs from a MySQL server. This is an alias
                      for read-from-remote-master=BINLOG-DUMP-NON-GTIDS.
  --read-from-remote-master=name
                      Read binary logs from a MySQL server through the
                      COM_BINLOG_DUMP or COM_BINLOG_DUMP_GTID commands by
                      setting the option to either BINLOG-DUMP-NON-GTIDS or
                      BINLOG-DUMP-GTIDS, respectively. If
                      --read-from-remote-master=BINLOG-DUMP-GTIDS is combined
                      with --exclude-gtids, transactions can be filtered out on
                      the master avoiding unnecessary network traffic.
  --raw               Requires -R. Output raw binlog data instead of SQL
                      statements, output is to log files.
  -r, --result-file=name
                      Direct output to a given file. With --raw this is a
                      prefix for the file names.
  --secure-auth       Refuse client connecting to server if it uses old
                      (pre-4.1.1) protocol. Deprecated. Always TRUE
  --server-id=#       Extract only binlog entries created by the server having
                      the given id.
  --server-id-bits=#  Set number of significant bits in server-id
  --set-charset=name  Add 'SET NAMES character_set' to the output.
  -s, --short-form    Just show regular queries: no extra info and no row-based
                      events. This is for testing only, and should not be used
                      in production systems. If you want to suppress
                      base64-output, consider using --base64-output=never
                      instead.
  -S, --socket=name   The socket file to use for connection.
  --ssl-mode=name     SSL connection mode.
  --ssl               Deprecated. Use --ssl-mode instead.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ssl to disable.)
  --ssl-verify-server-cert
                      Deprecated. Use --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY instead.
  --ssl-ca=name       CA file in PEM format.
  --ssl-capath=name   CA directory.
  --ssl-cert=name     X509 cert in PEM format.

                      TLSv1.2
  --server-public-key-path=name
                      File path to the server public RSA key in PEM format.
  --get-server-public-key
                      Get server public key
  --start-datetime=name
                      Start reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MySQL server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  -j, --start-position=#
                      Start reading the binlog at position N. Applies to the
                      first binlog passed on the command line.
  --stop-datetime=name
                      Stop reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MySQL server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  --stop-never        Wait for more data from the server instead of stopping at
                      the end of the last log. Implicitly sets --to-last-log
                      but instead of stopping at the end of the last log it
                      continues to wait till the server disconnects.
  --stop-never-slave-server-id=#
                      The slave server_id used for --read-from-remote-server
                      --stop-never. This option cannot be used together with
                      connection-server-id.
  --connection-server-id=#
                      The slave server_id used for --read-from-remote-server.
                      This option cannot be used together with
                      stop-never-slave-server-id.
  --stop-position=#   Stop reading the binlog at position N. Applies to the
                      last binlog passed on the command line.
  -t, --to-last-log   Requires -R. Will not stop at the end of the requested
                      binlog but rather continue printing until the end of the
                      last binlog of the MySQL server. If you send the output
                      to the same MySQL server, that may lead to an endless
                      loop.
  -u, --user=name     Connect to the remote server as username.
  -v, --verbose       Reconstruct pseudo-SQL statements out of row events. -v
                      -v adds comments on column data types.
  -V, --version       Print version and exit.
  --open-files-limit=#
                      Used to reserve file descriptors for use by this program.
  -c, --verify-binlog-checksum
                      Verify checksum binlog events.
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=#
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. This value must be a multiple of 256.
  --skip-gtids        Do not preserve Global Transaction Identifiers; instead
                      make the server execute the transactions as if they were
                      new.
  --include-gtids=name
                      Print events whose Global Transaction Identifiers were
                      provided.
  --exclude-gtids=name
                      Print all events but those whose Global Transaction
                      Identifiers were provided.
